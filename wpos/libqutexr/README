qutexr is an XML-RPC client and server library initially using Qt 3.1. now ported to Qt 5.12
qutexr only depends on QT, so it is portable to any platform supported by Qt 5.12,
including windows, many unix flavors, as well as Mac OSX.

qutexr makes use of Qt's native type system to avoid a burdensome interface.
Unlike many xmlrpc libraries, both the client and server are simple and easy
to incorporate into existing projects.

All methods are non-blocking and make use of Qt's signal and slot mechanism.
This makes this library very easy to use in GUIs as well as event driven
servers.

The library code is in the libqutexr/ directory.  There is an example client and 
server in the examples/ directory.

This code should be easy to use for anyone who is experienced with Qt.

Some errors have been fixed:
        one of them was the error that affected the
        comunication with kxmlrpcd... an xml header was missing.
